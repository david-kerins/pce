This is an implementation of prioritized queries using the Google SOAP Search API. 

These prioritized queries are generated from the parsing of valid prioritized constraint expressions (PCE). 

Prioritized constraint expressions use two unary operators to enhance an infinitesimal logic framework to allow preferential constraints and backup constraints respectively. 

The Perl CGI algorithm parses valid prioritized constraint expressions using a grammar and then generates a prioritized list of standard Google search queries. These standard Google queries are sent one at a time to Google via the Google SOAP Search API. The results of the search are returned as structured data to the user with their associated Truth value. 

Google deprecated the SOAP API and so this code cannot access the Google search engine anymore.
